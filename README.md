# -Identifying-road-lanes-for-autonomous-driving-systems
Our Lane Line Detection Project is a critical component in autonomous driving systems, enabling vehicles to recognize road boundaries and navigate safely. This is achieved by focusing on advanced image preprocessing techniques and utilizing deep learning (U-NET Architecture) methods to enhance detection accuracy and reliability.
